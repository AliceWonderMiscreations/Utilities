AliceWonderMiscreations Utilities
=================================

A collection of classes I use on several sites.

If anything here benefits people who are not me, well have it, but there is no
rhyme or reason to what happens to be here.

Well, no rhyme or reason for other people, there is rhyme and reason for me.

All classes I write are MIT license, that is how I roll.

There is a composer.json script but this is not in any composer repos, just
grab the file you need and use it.

The FileWrapper script has a dependency on
[JSqueeze](https://github.com/tchwork/jsqueeze)
